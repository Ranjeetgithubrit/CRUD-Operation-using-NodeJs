# CRUD-Operation-using-NodeJs

I have implemented MySQL crud operation with NodeJs API and things like how to connect with 
MySQL databases then how to implement insert update delete and retrieve using direct queries 
and also with already accessing stored procedures. Some of the concept I have used in this crud 
operation is how to make routes using express and more.
